# Yellevate: Client Disputes Data Analysis
**Problem**
Yellevate, a company which specializes in providing marketing services to other companies, has an annual revenue loss of approximately 5% due to loss disputes from clients who are unsatisfied with their services. All the services the company was hired to do were fully completed and the quality of the services provided is not the main driving reason for these invoice disputes. The management believes most disputes are the result of contract technicalities or clients thinking they can get away with not paying for the services. Determining the reason for these disputes and how the company can minimize them will in turn reduce the companyâ€™s annual revenue loss.

**Methodology**

&nbsp; **1. Data Importation and Cleaning in Postgre SQL**

**1.A. Create a table in SQL using the query below. Import the file yellevate_invoices.csv to the created table.**

SQL Syntax:
```sh
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS yellevate_invoices(
country varchar,
customerID varchar,
InvoiceNumber numeric,
InvoiceDate date,
DueDate date,
InvoiceAmount numeric,
disputed numeric,
DisputeLost numeric,
SettledDate date,
DaysToSettle integer,
DaysLate integer
);
```
**1.B. Import the file yellevate_invoices.csv to the created table.**

**1.C. Finding the average processing time in which invoices are settled (in days):**

SQL syntax:
```sh
SELECT ROUND(AVG(DaysToSettle)) AS avg_days_settled 
FROM yellevate_invoices;
```

**1.D. Finding the processing time for the company to settle disputes (in days):**

SQL syntax:
```sh
SELECT ROUND(AVG(daystosettle)) as avg_processing_time
FROM yellevate_invoices
WHERE disputed = 1 AND disputelost = 0;
```

**1.E. Finding the percentage of disputes received by the company that were lost:**

SQL syntax:
```sh
SELECT ROUND((SUM(disputelost)/COUNT(disputed))*100, 2) AS percent_dispute_lost
FROM yellevate_invoices
WHERE disputed = 1;
```

**1.F. Finding the percentage of revenue lost from disputes:**

SQL syntax:
```sh
SELECT ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN disputelost = 1 THEN invoiceamount ELSE 0 END)/SUM(invoiceamount))*100, 2) as percent_revenue_lost
FROM yellevate_invoices;
```

**1.G. Finding the country where the company reached the highest losses from lost disputes (in USD):**

SQL syntax:
```sh
SELECT country, SUM(CASE WHEN disputelost = 1 THEN invoiceamount else 0 END) as total_loss
FROM yellevate_invoices
WHERE disputed = 1
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_loss DESC;
```

**3.) Generate insights from your analysis to provide recommendations on probable strategies to deal with disputes effectively.**

1.	**Review and improve contract drafting:** As most disputes are the result of contract technicalities, the company should consider reviewing and improvising the contract drafting process. To achieve this, the company should collaborate with legal professionals to identify and detect any uncertainties, inconsistencies or loopholes in the contract terms that can lead to disputes. Clarity and transparency of the contract terms will help in reducing the number of disputes and increasing the client satisfaction.

2.	**Streamline dispute resolution process:** By streamlining the dispute resolution process this will make the process more efficient yet effective with faster and simpler methods. Long dispute settlement times can be a major source of frustration for clients and can lead to a conflict in communication between the company and to its clients. In order to streamline the process, the company must be able to identify the cause of the delays and addressing them. This could involve improving communication networks, providing up-to-date updates to clients on the status of their dispute. and implementing efficient and transparent dispute resolution procedures.

3.	**Improve client communication:** Considering quality of service may not be the main reason for disputes, effective communication with clients can help in reducing disputes. Improving on how the company communicate with its clients should be put in to consideration. This can be achieved by providing clear and timely information on the services offered, contract terms, payment procedures, and other relevant information. This could involve investing in client relationship management and communication skills training.

4.	**Implement data analytics tools:** With proper data analytics tools, it can be used in identifying patterns in client disputes. This could also help in improving the dispute resolution process and prevent disputes to happen. Investing in data analytics tools can provide insights with the causes of disputes, kinds of disputes that are common, and the effectiveness of the company's dispute resolution procedures. This could involve hiring data analysts or collaboration with a data analytics firm.

**4.) Sales Analysis and Areas of Improvement (Additional Analysis)**
1.	**Total sales:** We can calculate the total sales by summing up the â€˜InvoiceAmountâ€™ column excluding â€˜DisputeLostâ€™.

**Based from the information provided, we can identify the areas for improvement. These are some potential recommendations:**

1.	**High dispute rate:** We need to identify the dispute and its causes and develops strategic methods to address them. Possible causes of disputes could include unclear contract terms and poor communication with clients. To address these issues, we may need to review and modify contracts and improve how we communicate with our clients.

2.	**Low sales in certain countries and customers:** If sales are low in certain countries and customers, we may need to investigate the reasons on having this issue and to implement effective marketing strategies to generate more sales. This may involve conducting market research to identify the demand and needs or offering customized services for specific customers

3.	**Seasonal patterns in sales:** If there are seasonal patterns in sales, we may need to adjust staffing levels or inventory to meet demand during peak seasons. This could involve hiring temporary workers or increasing inventory levels during high-demand periods.

4.	**Slow dispute resolution:** If disputes take too long to get resolved, we may need to implement faster, easier, yet effective dispute resolution process. This could involve hiring additional staff or investing in technology to automate the dispute resolution process.
